\section{Subgraph Isomorphism}

We are given two graphs, \(G_1 = (V_1, E_1)\) and \(G_2 = (V_2, E_2)\). The subgraph isomorphism problem (\textit{SGI}) is to determine if there exists a subgraph of \(G_2\) which is isomorphic to \(G_1\).

\subsection*{Part A}

To prove that \(\mathit{SGI} \in \mathit{NP}\) we must show that there is a way to verify a solution to the problem in polynomial time.

If we are given a solution to an \textit{SGI} problem in the form of a subgraph \(G_3 = (V_3, E_3) \subseteq G_2\) and a bijection \(f : V_1 \to V_3\), i.e. \(f\) maps from the vertices of \(G_1\) to the vertices of \(G_3\), then we can verify that they are in fact isomorphic as follows.

\begin{algorithm}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\Function{Isomorphic}{$G_1, G_3, f$}
		\For{\((u, v) \in E_1\)}
		\If{\((f(u), f(v)) \notin E_3\)}
		\Return false
		\EndIf
		\EndFor
		\State \Return true
		\EndFunction
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This algorithm is clearly \(O(E)\), so is polynomial. Therefore \(\mathit{SCI} \in \mathit{NP}\).
