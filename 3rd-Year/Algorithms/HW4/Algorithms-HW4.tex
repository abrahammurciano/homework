\section{Dijkstra's Algorithm with negative weights}

\subsection*{Part A}

Figure \ref{q1a} shows a graph with negative weights such that if we apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between vertices \(S\) and \(D\), it will return the wrong path.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		[vertex/.style={circle, draw=black, node distance=0.8cm}]
		\node[vertex] (S) {\(S\)};
		\node[vertex, above right=of S] (v1) {\(v_1\)};
		\node[vertex, below right=of S] (v2) {\(v_2\)};
		\node[vertex, below right=of v1] (D) {\(D\)};
		\draw (S) to["4"] (v1);
		\draw (S) to["8" below left] (v2);
		\draw (v1) to["2"] (D);
		\draw (v2) to["-4" below right] (D);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Graph for which Dijkstra doesn't work}
	\label{q1a}
\end{figure}

Starting off, we assign the unvisited vertices \(v_1\) and \(v_2\) with the distances 4 and 8 respectively, marking \(S\) as visited. Then we take the unvisited vertex with the smallest distance, \(v_1\), and check its neighbours, namely \(D\). We assign it the distance 6 and mark \(v_1\) as visited. Now that our destination vertex is the unvisited vertex with the shortest distance, the algorithm would claim that it has finished, with the shortest path going through \(v_1\) with a distance of 6.

However, in reality the shortest path goes through \(v_2\) and has a total distance of \(8 - 4 = 4\). This path was not considered by the algorithm because the path to the intermediate vertex \(v_2\) has a larger distance than the path it found first.

\subsection*{Part B}

If we take the example graph in figure \ref{q1a} and modify it so that the edges are directed (away from \(S\) or towards \(D\)), then that would form a directed acyclic graph for which Dijkstra's algorithm would not work for a similar reason to that of part A.
